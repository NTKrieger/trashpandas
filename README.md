I made this Reddit mirror as a bit of a resume piece when I knew that my time at Cleveland Public Library was coming to a close.  I was very meticulous in my re-engineering of the Reddit UI and although this is written in an older style and I hadn't yet discovered linting, I'm still pretty proud of the final product.

I built this project on top of a very simple beginners tutorial from Pure React by Dave Ceddia.
